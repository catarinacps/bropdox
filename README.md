# **bropdox**
A DropBox clone as defined in the final assignment for SISOP 2.\
It is a 2 part assignment and we'll use UNIX UDP sockets API in the communication\
between the *Server* and the *Client* threads.

## **Building the project**

We are using the [inotify-cpp](https://github.com/erikzenker/inotify-cpp) lib/wrapper to watch any file modification on the\
client's directory.

### **Make**
The Makefile has the following interface:
- **all**\
Builds the target `mainClient` and `mainServer` executables.
- **clean**\
Cleans the generated `.o`'s, binaries and temporary files.
- **redo**\
Does the `all` and then the `clean` rules.
- **test**\
Does the `all` rule and then nothing because the tests do not exist yet.

## **Logic**
As of now, the project follows roughly this beautiful diagram I made myself:

Extra details can be found in the Moodle course page. I'll later populate this Readme further.
